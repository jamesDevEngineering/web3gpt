# Deploy Contracts

Write smart contracts by simply describing your ideas. Our AI Agents reason, plan, then produce ready-to-compile & deploy Solidity smart contracts.

## Simple Example

Suppose you want to create an ERC20 token called "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK" and a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens. Just describe it in natural language:

```plaintext
Create an ERC20 token named MyToken with symbol MTK and total supply of 1,000,000 tokens.
```

Web3GPT will generate the Solidity code for you:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

## Deploying a Smart Contract

### Steps

1. **Describe Your Idea:** Enter your idea, whether it's a contract, protocol, dApp idea, or utility.

2. **Generate the Code:** The AI agent will plan, ask follow-up questions if needed, and produce the Solidity code for your request.

3. **Review the Code:** Examine the generated code and request changes in chat if necessary. Ensure there are no omitted or placeholder sections.

4. **Deploy:**

   - **Agent Deploy:** Deploy your contract without needing a wallet. Simply specify the target chain (e.g., "Deploy to X chain"), and the Agent will handle the deployment.
   - **Manual Deployment:** Connect your wallet and click the Deploy Contract button above the source code to deploy the smart contract.

   Note: If the contract has Ownable access control, or has interactions with the deployer, you should provide your wallet address and request ownership of the contract in the chat.

5. **View Deployment Results:** Navigate to the explorer link. The contract will be automatically verified within 1 minute of deployment. Visit the IPFS directory to view source code and compilation files.

### Error Handling

If there are compilation errors, the agent will attempt to resolve them and show updates. For incorrect or missing parameters, the agent may retry or ask for additional information.
